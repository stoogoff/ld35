Mutation

Werewolves, swans and fox spirits

Slaine / Cuchulain

Tetris pieces, moving, changing

Caterpillars turning into butterflies

Any kind of animal transformation would require a LOT of artwork

Could tie it in with music, so changes change the music between major and minor keys

Changing a shape from one to another (e.g. square to triangle) to better fit in somewhere or do something

Something with shifting squares, enlarge one shrinks the others, have to get some sort of balance between them? Changing shapes to fit in with a pattern or puzzle type thing

Drawing shapes to make music. Have to match the shape to fit the tone. If you're off the music is off

A game where you play as the caterpillar, collecting things to help you change. At the end of the game you change into a butterfly. Possibly a butterfly of doom and it's not game over, just the game changes with you roaming around hunting down your enemies.

Shapechange as mimicry or camouflage.

Roam around a maze. There's a shape you have to turn yourself into to complete the level. You do this by collection other shapes which are roaming around too.

You have to unlock a door. To do this you need a key. To build the key you need to know what shape the keyhole is.
